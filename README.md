# Math
Types of math and their history
This is meant to show types of math and the history of math.
Anyone can use this, if they want to, but from no on there will be less changes until something happens or I learn something new
that I can connect to html. This is my first webpage I ever made.
The history section is made out of only wikipedia and if you want to go there you can search "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"

Note to anyone in my class: DON'T TELL MS. POWERS I USED WIKI!!!
